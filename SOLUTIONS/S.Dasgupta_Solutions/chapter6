6.1 A contiguous subsequence of a list S is a subsequence made up of consecutive
    elements of S. For instance, if S is 
        5,15,-30,10,-5,40,10
    then 15,-30,10 is a contiguous subsequence but 5,15,40 is not.
    Given an alogorithm for the following task
    Input: a list of numbers a1,a2,..an
    Output: The contiguous subsequences of maximum sum

    Use prefixSum to find the sum to a given number.
